# Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance
Attendance system which marks whether or not a student/person is present or not by recognising their face from a trained single-label image classification model. This is then updated in a Google Sheet along with the time the person was detected at. The model was trained using Teachable Machine by Google and run on Google Colab.
